"# cuda-by-example-source" 

Example source that is under my own github repository because original repo snapshot of code as it is has full of omimssions and errors.
I created exact duplicate in my own git repo under the 2nd ever commit of this repo: 


commit fd33770f113c16241ba71acfc0f83242d2f259ba

    unchanged code of cuda book from original repo

which means if you checkout this code, the code snapshot is same as:

origin  https://github.com/jiekebo/CUDA-By-Example.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/jiekebo/CUDA-By-Example.git (push)

This code assumes it is checked into following folder:
c:\git.co\CUDA-By-Example>
as example CUDA VS projects under:
origin  https://github.com/jiekebo/CUDA-By-Example.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/jiekebo/CUDA-By-Example.git (push)

has vc++ add'l include directory settings that points to: c:\git.co\CUDA-By-Example>.

The initial checkin and entire project on both of above github repository is built and maintained in
Windows 10, VC15 and cuda9.1 version.
or more precisely:
- NVIDIA CUDA Development 9.1
- Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2015 14.0.24215
